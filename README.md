###Client Framework:
------
####React Native

------
###Server Setup:
------
####Node.js & Express

------
###Database
------
####Mongodb & Mongoose
The Mongodb database has 3 tables: users, matchrequests, and successfulmatches (schema can be found in db/config.js). 
  - The users table has 5 columns: username, firstname, email, funfact, profileimage) which are set at the time of user signup.
  - The matchrequests table has 5 columns: username, latitude, longitude, isActive, and timestamp.
      > isActive is a boolean that flags whether the given matchRequest has been fulfilled.
      > Timestamp is set automatically. The server uses the timestamp to determine whether or not a given match is valid. Currently, any matchrequest older than 45s is considered to be invalid.
  - db/config.js contains the database schema and mongoose models for User, MatchRequest, and SuccessfulMatch

Database helper functions can be found in db/db.js. These helper functions are used by the request handlers in server/config/requestHandler.js
  - getUsers will return a list of userts matching the passed-in arguments.
  - checkIfUserExists will return a boolean value based on whether a given user exists in the database.
  - addUser will add a new user to the database.
  - getAllUsers will return a full list of users in the database. This function is not currently used, but may come in handy in the future.
  - removeUser will remove the specified user from the database. This function is not currently used, but may come in handy in the future.
  - getMatchRequests will return a list of matchRequests that meet the time cutoff (requestTimeCutoff)
  - getSuccessfulMatchForUser will return the successful match (if any) for a given user. Any match that is older than 1min will not be returned. This time cutoff has been included to prevent the system from accidentally returning old matches.
  - updateUser will update a user's database entry with the new values provided
